# HEART-DISEASE

INTRODUCTION - Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction of heart conditions can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely interventions. This project leverages Machine Learning techniques to develop a predictive model for assessing the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data. The dataset used for this project includes Heart dataset and consists of features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

OBJECTIVE - To predict heart disease according to input parameter values provided by user and dataset stored in database

TECHNOLOGY USED - Programming Language: Python, ML
                  Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
                  Tools: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub
